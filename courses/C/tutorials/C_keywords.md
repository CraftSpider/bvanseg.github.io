# Keywords

In C, there are a set of keywords that you can not have as names for variables or functions. These words are important to **know of**, but not to remember their usages (yet). Here are all the keywords in C:

| | | | |
|---|---|---| --- |
| auto | break | case | char
| const | continue | default | do
| double | else | enum | extern
| float | for | goto | if
| int | long | register | return
| short | signed | sizeof | static
| struct | switch | typedef | union
| unsigned | void | volatile | while

A lot of these you may rarely use, such as **volatile** or **register**. But since they are built-in, they can't be used as names for data that you define.

Typically, your IDE will show some sort of clue that it is a keyword, most often through highlighting it a certain color.
