# Welcome to Lua
*The fast, portable, embeddable, powerful, small FOSS language named after the moon*

## Brief introduction
Lua is an easy-to-learn, lightweight scripting language. It employs strongly- and dynamically-typed multi-paradigm programming with lexical scoping and first-class functions.

### Lua syntax makes sense
Lua's syntax feels somewhat natural to math, and often times pseudocode translates almost directly into Lua script. Understanding Lua is straightforward to anyone with prior experience in another scripting language (especially shell or Python).

### Lua data makes sense
There are eight kinds of data in Lua. Other languages can have over twenty, or potentially infinite as the programmer can define more ways to hold data. By contrast, Lua's eight *data types*, as they're called, are simple yet flexible enough to suit every purpose you could possibly have.

### Lua paradigms make sense
*Paradigms* are the "mindsets" of programming, to put it in a word. Not all languages are written in a "here's a list of instructions, do them in order", and so they are characterized by the programmers' mindsets they expect. Lua supports a healthy range of paradigms, allowing for many programmers' expectations and code styles to be satisfied without much unexpected behavior.

Hopefully, I've sold you on this marvellous language, and you're ready to dive right in. All of these tutorials are written for Lua 5.3.5, but most of the information applies to any version of Lua 5.0+

Most of these lessons are adapted from Programming In Lua, 4th Edition. I highly advise you buy the book – it goes into far more detail than I do, and was written by someone with **years** of experience teaching Lua. Plus, it is a major source of financially supporting the language.

In these lessons, *italics* will be used when important terminology is brought up, and `monospace` will represent actual code, sometimes in larger boxes containing full examples.

Cheers!
